# Doing Data Science.

### Introduction

We are going to create a website to highlight your work in this class!  Hopefully and potentially highlight our work throughout your time as a student, hopefully and potentially throughout our career!  


### Activity Three: Create a Welcome Tab  

- ` 1. -Create multiple tabs and make the first tab: “About Me” (Or something to that effect.
- ` 2. -On this tab, add as much or as little information about yourself as you like.

+ `Possible and Interesting Information may include:

        + `Your name.
        + `A picture.
        + `Where you are from.
        + `Your Interests.
        + `Where You Work.
        + `Where you went to school.

- `Again, it is not required to add a lot of information to this page, if you prefer to keep your information private, just make up a name and information.

+ `3. Near the bottom, or somewhere that makes sense, add something to the effect of: “The other tabs represent work / analyses that I have completed. Please check them out!”

- `Beers_Project_Case_Study.rmd` Add a tab labeled: “Beer Study” or “Case Study 1” Or something to that effect. 
- `Add your knit RMD html or pdf document to this page.  

# Activity Five: Create an Rshiny App 

1. Create a Rshiny app that will do the following
    Let the user read in the data (the Beer Data.) 
    Let the user make a histogram of the IBU
    Let the user make a histogram of the ABV  (separate histogram)
    Low the user switch back and forth between histograms and boxplots to represent this information.  You could do this with a radio button that switches the       plot from histogram to boxplot … the implementation however is up to you.  
    Allow the user to filter the histograms / boxplots above by state. 
    In addition to the histograms, add a scatter plot of IBU v. ABV
    Add the ability to add or take off the simple linear regression line. 
    Allow the user to filter the data on the scatter plot by state.
    Add at least one additional plot from your analysis and make sure to clearly label and/or describe the information it is conveying.  


2. Add the link to the tab you created for Case Study 1.
